## 📂 Design Files Structure

The project is managed entirely within **KiCad**. The following files are included in the main directory:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `STM32.kicad_pro` | The main KiCad project file. |
| `STM32.kicad_sch` | The primary schematic document for the STM32 controller. |
| `STM32.kicad_pcb` | The complete PCB layout file, including routing, layers, and footprints. |
| `nrf.kicad_sch` | A separate schematic sheet detailing the integration of the nRF wireless module. |
| `RF(pin change).kicad_sym` | Custom schematic symbol for the RF component or a related section. |

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Viewing the Design)

To open, inspect, or modify the design files, you must have KiCad installed.

### Prerequisites

1.  **KiCad EDA:** Download and install the latest stable version from the [official KiCad website](https://www.kicad.org/download/).

### How to Open

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/GaLv0331/STM32F405RGT6_Controller_Design.git](https://github.com/GaLv0331/STM32F405RGT6_Controller_Design.git)
    ```
2.  **Open Project:** Launch KiCad and open the main project file: `STM32.kicad_pro`.
3.  From the KiCad project manager, you can then launch the Schematic Editor or the PCB Layout Editor to view the respective files.
